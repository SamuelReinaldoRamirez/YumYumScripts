By the look of the exterior I probably wouldn’t have entered had I not checked Google reviews before… as the decor was somber and didn’t give an appetizing look to be honest.\n\nHowever the food proved me wrong, we ordered lunch menu with the fried chicken as starter and bibimbap as main dish. The fried chicken was divine! So juicy and not greasy at all, the sweet and slightly spicy sauce blended perfectly with the batter, very delicious! The bibimbap itself was great too, it contained lots of ingredients especially vegetables, as they continued to cook in the stone ball they created a nice texture and taste together with the rice. I ordered the squid one, I should maybe have taken the beef and porc version as the squid was a bit chewy and not a lot of flavor. The other small negative point was probably that they were not very generous with the the pickled side dishes (see photo).\n\nOverall I had a good dining experience and will definitely go back to try other dishes.\n\nUpdate: we went back for the fried chicken and rice sticks, super delicious and you wouldn’t tell they were deep fried!
